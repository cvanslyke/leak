# Leak Graph

## Requirements

- Java 1.8
- Cygwin (Windows)

## Build and Run

Build: 

    ./gradlew build

Run:
 
    cd into scripts directory and execute the "leak.sh" script.
    
## Notes

The software creates a "LeakDetection" directory in your ~/Documents folder. Sub-directories are placed in there for "readings" and "projects". "projects" is the default open/save directory for Projects, and "readings" is the default open location when adding readings.


# TODO

1. Print Functionality, test existing print functionality and come up with a way to print out a package that includes graph and readings and notes.
2. Add logo somewhere to chart or something.
3. Come up with an executable that someone could double-click on to run software.
4. Double-click a project file and open it with Leak Graph
